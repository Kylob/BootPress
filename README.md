Jump start your code with these decoupled PHP components that can be used in any project.

- **Asset** - Caches and delivers assets of every sort, from any location, with hands-off versioning.  Manipulates images on-the-fly.  Minifies and combines (on-demand) css and javascript files.
- **Auth** - Manages users and logs them in securely using the definitive best practices known to man.
- **Blog** - A file based blog that can be implemented in any project with full-text searching, featured and similar posts, pages, listings, archives, authors, tags, categories, sitemap and feed.
- **Bootstrap** - Create Bootstrap grids, tables, forms, buttons, dropdowns, groups, navs, breadcrumbs, pagination, panels, accordions, carousels, etc ... all without touching a single div!
- **Database** - A PDO wrapper with lazy connections, query profiling, and convenience methods that simplify and speed up your queries.
- **Form** - Coordinates form validation, errors, messages, values, and inputs in a DRY KISS way.
- **Hierarchy** - Nested Set benefits with Adjacency List effort.  Retrieve the children, counts, levels, paths, trees, nests, and leaves from your category nodes.
- **Page** - A framework agnostic HTML framwork that allows you to manipulate every part of an HTML page at any time.
- **Pagination** - Creates customizable pagination and pager links.
- **Sitemap** - A sitemap generator that tracks updates, and makes your entire site searchable.
- **SQLite** - Extends the Database component to create and update tables and indexes at will.  Simplifies FTS full-text searching.
- **Table** - Builds HTML tables that are easy to visualize and see what is going on.
- **Theme** - A Smarty theme manager for layouts that utilizes the Page and Bootstrap components.
- **Validator** - Form validation that is designed to simplify and work seamlessly with Jorn's jQuery Validation Plugin.

Documentation is forth-coming, and will be completed by v1.0.  If you star this project at GitHub it will spur me on knowing that someone cares.
